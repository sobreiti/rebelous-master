== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this theme support any plugins? =
Rebelous includes support for Infinite Scroll, content options, and social menu in Jetpack. It also supports all default Gutenberg blocks

= How to set the circular image in the header? =
It will pull in the admin's gravatar by default. For a custom image, go to customizer and add a custom logo under 'Site Identity'.

= I set a custom logo, and it's not round anymore.
That's intentional, because you might want a different shaped logo. If your image is square, add this css code.
    .custom-logo { 
        border-radius: 50%; 
    }

= I don't want your link in my footer/I want my own copyright information =
That's okay. I don't have a way of changing this in settings, but you can use some css code like this:
    .author-credit {
        font-size: 0;
    }

    .author-credit::after {
        content: "Â© 2019 YourAwesomeName";
        font-size: 0.875rem;
    }
